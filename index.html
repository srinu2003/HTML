            <blockquote>
                <p>What do I wear to an interview?</p>
                <p>Dress smartly preferably in a suit. Both men and women should wear conservative clothes, men ensure
                    your shirts are ironed and your tie is not too garish. Women have the option to wear trousers or a
                    skirt, and shoes should be sensible.</p>
                <p>What does an interview entail?</p>
                <p>If you have reached the interview stage the employer has already noted from your CV that you have the
                    essential qualifications for the job. An interview expands on this and shows what you are like in
                    person and whether your character is suitable for the company. An interview also provides you with
                    an insight into what it is like to work at this company. You will be asked questions relating to
                    your previous positions your experience and what responsibilities you have held. The interviewer
                    will probably ask you about certain aspects of your CV and what your long-term career goals are.</p>
                <p>What should I take to an interview?</p>
                <p>Take a couple of copies of your CV in case the one you sent to the company has gone astray. If
                    possible take a portfolio of relevant work which you have done. A pen and paper to make notes with
                    after the interview, perhaps you need to take a tube map or A-Z so that you can find the offices in
                    the first place.</p>
                <p>What sort of questions can I expect?</p>
                <p>The interviewer wants to assess your suitability for the job, so you will be asked about what your
                    previous responsibilities entailed, your qualifications, why you want the job, what you can bring to
                    the company and perhaps some questions about what you enjoy doing out of work.</p>
                <p>How long are interviews?</p>
                <p>An interview usually lasts for about an hour, you should definitely aim to be in the office for at
                    least that amount of time.</p>
                <p>Who will interview me?</p>
                <p>The head of the department to which you are applying, or a member of the human resources team will
                    interview you. It is possible that there will be more than one interviewer, in which case the panel
                    will be made up of HR personnel, Managers, and people who you would be working with directly should
                    you get the job.</p>
                <p>Are there different types of interview?</p>
                <p>Interviews can be conducted in a number of ways. There are one-on-one interviews, panel/committee
                    interviews, lunchtime interviews, and telephone interviews. Whilst the format may vary, the purpose
                    of the interview will be the same, to get an insight into your personality and to see if you are
                    suitable for their company.</p>
                <p>How should I prepare for an interview?</p>
                <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Carry out research into the company, find out exactly what they do, and how many people they
                        employ. What is their history and what is their future business strategy.</li>
                    <li>Make sure you know exactly where your interview is so you arrive punctually on the day.</li>
                    <li>You may like to practice by answering some commonly posed interview questions.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>What qualities are interviewers looking for?</p>
                <p>The things that interviews will be looking for depends upon the industry sector and type of job that
                    you are applying to. Generally employers are looking for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Motivation</li>
                    <li>Confidence</li>
                    <li>Sociability</li>
                    <li>Initiative</li>
                    <li>Honesty</li>
                    <li>Intellect</li>
                    <li>Enthusiasm</li>
                </ul>
